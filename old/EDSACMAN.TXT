NAME

edsac -- EDSAC simulator

SYNOPSIS

edsac [ [ -csr01] [ file ] ] ...

DESCRIPTION

Edsac simulates the execution of the EDSAC computer.  The files
on the command line represent tapes to be set up in the tape
reader and the options -c, -s, and -r represent buttons on the
machine's control panel.  A file argument means "Place this 'tape'
in the reader"; an option means "Press this button."  The "button"
options are interpreted as follows:

-c	Clear button.  Clear the store & the registers.

-s	Start button.  Load and execute the initial orders.

-r  Reset button.  Restart the machine after it stops.

The September 1949 initial orders are used by default unless one of the
following options is specified:

-0	Use the May 1949 initial orders for the following programs.
-1	Use the September 1949 initial orders for the following programs.

If no files are specified or - is used as a file name, the standard input
is read.  If there are no files or options on the command line, the clear
and start buttons are automatically pressed.

EXAMPLES

Punch "program.e", and execute it, printing the results:

punch program.e | edsac | tprint

Execute the program in "tape" and then run a post-mortem routine ("post").

edsac tape -cs post -r | tprint

SEE ALSO

punch(EDSAC), tprint(EDSAC)

BUGS

The use of command line arguments to simulate pressing buttons is awkward,
to say the least.  In particular, it is difficult to remember to put -s
at the end of the command line when files are specified or the -0 option is
being used.
