NAME

punch -- EDSAC keyboard perforator

SYNOPSIS

punch [ [ -xstring ] [ file ] ] ...


DESCRIPTION

Punch reads characters from the named files and translates them to
their equivalent in the EDSAC perforator code.  Lower case letters
are translated to upper case; illegal characters are ignored.  If
- is specified as a file name, the standard input is read.  The -x
option is used to "punch" strings directly.  Alternative characters
and escape sequences are provided for the EDSAC's special codes that
are not normally included in modern computer character sets.

EDSAC Code      Escape Sequence    Alternative
Erase                 \e                *
Blank tape           none               .
Pi                    \p                #
Theta                 \h                @
Delta                 \d                &

By convention, the extenstions ".e0" and ".e1" are used for programs
that use the May and the September 1949 versions, respectively, of the
EDSAC initial orders.  ".e" is also used as a synonym for ".e1".

EXAMPLES

Punch "file1" and save the results in the file "tape1":

punch file1 >tape1
